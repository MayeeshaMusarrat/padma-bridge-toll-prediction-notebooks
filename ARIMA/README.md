## ARIMA Model for Padma Bridge Toll Prediction

### What is ARIMA?
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a statistical model for time series forecasting. It combines:
- **AutoRegressive (AR):** Relationship between current and past values.
- **Integrated (I):** Differencing to achieve stationarity.
- **Moving Average (MA):** Relationship between current value and past errors.

ARIMA is widely used for predicting future values in time series data, such as traffic volume and cash collection at toll stations.

### Data Processing Steps
1. **Data Loading:**
   - The dataset (`Padma_Bridge - Traffic.csv`) is loaded with pandas, parsing 'Date' as datetime and setting it as the index.
2. **Visualization:**
   - Traffic and cash data for Mawa and Jajira stations are visualized to understand trends and seasonality.
3. **Stationarity Check:**
   - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is performed to check for stationarity.
4. **Autocorrelation Analysis:**
   - ACF and PACF plots help determine AR and MA order.
5. **Model Training:**
   - ARIMA models are trained for traffic and cash data for both stations.
6. **Forecasting:**
   - Models forecast traffic and cash for the next N days (default: 10 days).
7. **Visualization & Summary:**
   - Forecasts are visualized, and summary tables show mean, max, min, standard deviation, and trend.
